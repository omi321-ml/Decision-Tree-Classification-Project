Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Decision Tree Classifier using Python.
Decision Tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks.
Here, it is applied to perform classification on a given dataset.

🎯 Objectives

Implement Decision Tree Classification

Split dataset into features and target variables

Train and test the machine learning model

Evaluate model performance using standard metrics

🧠 Algorithm Used

Decision Tree Classifier

Criterion: gini / entropy

Library: scikit-learn

🗂️ Dataset Description

The dataset contains:

Features (X): Independent variables used for prediction

Target (y): Dependent variable / class label

The dataset is loaded and processed inside the Jupyter Notebook.
